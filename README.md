# Toman-Bike-Share-Project
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis solution, from data cleaning to interactive visualization. The goal was to analyze the performance of Toman Bike Share, transforming raw data into a dynamic Power BI dashboard that reveals key business trends and supports strategic decision-making.
# Methodology & Tools
Data Cleaning and Preparation (SQL): The initial raw dataset was meticulously cleaned and pre-processed using SQL. This critical step involved handling inconsistencies, null values, and structuring the data to ensure its accuracy and integrity before analysis.
# Data Modeling and Visualization (Power BI):
The cleaned data was then imported into Microsoft Power BI. A robust data model was built, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create complex calculations for key metrics like profit margin and year-over-year growth. The final step was to design and build an intuitive, interactive dashboard.
# Key Insights & Analysis
The dashboard provides a comparative analysis of the company's performance between 2021 and 2022, revealing significant growth and actionable trends.
