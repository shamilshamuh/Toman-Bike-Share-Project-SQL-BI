# Recommendations 

• Conservative Increase: To avoid hitting a price ceiling and risking customer loss, a 10–15% price increase is suggested. It's a cautious approach following a significant hike last year.
- Price Projections: If the 2022 price was $4.99,
then:
- A 10% increase would bring it to about $5.49.
- A 15% increase would raise it to around $5.74.

 • Strategy Recommendations:
- Market Analysis: Understand customer satisfaction, economic factors, and competitor pricing.
- Segmented Pricing: Differentiate pricing for casual and registered users based on their sensitivity to price.
- Monitor and Adjust: Launch the new price, then carefully track sales and feedback to fine-tune if needed.
